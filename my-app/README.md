This project was created using Create React App. It includes scripts that can be used to run the application, test it, and build it for production. The application can be run in development mode using the npm start command and can be viewed in a browser at http://localhost:3000. The test runner can be launched in interactive watch mode using the npm test command. To build the app for production, the npm run build command can be used which creates a build folder with a minified and optimized version of the application. The npm run eject command can be used to remove the build dependency and give the user full control over the configuration files and dependencies. The Create React App documentation provides more information about these commands and features.
