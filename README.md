This project follows the MVC architecture and consists of both frontend and backend components. The backend folder structure includes an index.js file as the entry point, which contains the Mongoose connection and port details, and routes.js file for API calls. The userController.js file acts as a middleware for database queries, and the user model is defined in User.js file.

The frontend includes a React login page that authenticates users with a backend API and four pages (Home, About, Jobs, and Contact) created using React components and React Router. Each page includes a card component that provides more information about the page's content. The entry point for the frontend is index.js, and the routes are defined in App.js file. Nav.js and nav.css files are used for designing the navigation bar, and Login.js and Login.css files are used for designing and validating the login form.

The login screen calls userLogin function present in userAction.js, which further calls the userServiceLogin.js. The post/login URL is hit using Axios, and the response from the REST API is passed back to the login page. If the user credentials are correct, the validate boolean is returned as true, and the user is navigated to the Home page; otherwise, an alert is popped asking the user to enter valid credentials.
